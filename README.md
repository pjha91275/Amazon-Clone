## 🛑 Browser Warning Notice

> ⚠️ **Important:** When you open the live site link, your browser may show a security warning (red background) saying the site is dangerous or deceptive.

This is a **false warning** caused because the project is hosted on **GitHub Pages** and looks visually similar to real website of Amazon.

To proceed and view the site:

1. On the red warning page, click the **"Details"** button at the bottom.  
2. New paragraphs will be added to the bottom of the same page if opened on Desktop or a new warning page will appear with some text and a red background if opened on Mobile.  
3. On the last line, you'll see the phrase **“visit this unsafe site”** — only **“this unsafe site”** will be underlined and acts as a clickable link.  
4. Click that underlined text to open the site normally.
